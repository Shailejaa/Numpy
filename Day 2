### It's Day 2 of learning Numpy Library. Getting constant doubt about why, how and when to use and all. But I guess i will get answers for all my question through practicals only.
### So lately I accepted that I cannot know everything about Numpy but yes, I can try to learn little by little.
##I might have made many mistakes, so if you find any please do suggest I welcome all suggestion.
